                The First Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Article 8(j) and Related Provisions (SB8J-1) will take place from 27 to 30 October 2025 in Panama City, Panama. This milestone follows a historic decision adopted at COP 16, where Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) agreed to establish a new permanent Subsidiary Body dedicated to Article 8(j) and other provisions concerning Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IPLCs). The body aims to elevate IPLC issues within CBD processes and strengthen their participation and contributions toward global biodiversity goals.
